/**
 * mindsensors-touchmux.h provides an API for the Mindsensors Touch Sensor MUX.  This program
 * demonstrates how to use that API in combination with a HiTechnic Sensor MUX.
 *
 * The author of this program cannot be held responsible for the effects of this unholy
 * union.  Loss of life due to universal existance failure or accidentally created
 * wormholes may occur.  You have been warned.
 *
 * Changelog:
 * - 0.1: Initial release
 *
 * Credits:
 * - Big thanks to Mindsensors and HiTechnic for providing me with the hardware necessary to write and test this.
 *
 * License: You may use this code as you wish, provided you give credit where it's due.
 *
 * THIS CODE WILL ONLY WORK WITH ROBOTC VERSION 4.10 AND HIGHER
