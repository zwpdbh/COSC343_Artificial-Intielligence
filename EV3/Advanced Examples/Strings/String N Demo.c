|*  This program demos the basic string n manipulation functions in ROBOTC which behave similarly to      *|
|*  those found in the standard C libraries.  Looking that the Global Variables screen on the Debugger    *|
|*  is a great way to see how the variables are being manipulated.                                        *|
|*                                                                                                        *|
|*                                        ROBOT CONFIGURATION                                             *|
|*    NOTES:                                                                                              *|
|*    1)  Only the NXT brick is required, no motors, no sensors.                                          *|
|*    2)  "strncat()" takes 2 strings and an int.  It concatinates the 2nd string to the end of the 1st,  *|
|*        overwriting the 1st string.  The int determines from the first character in the 2nd string,     *|
|*        how many chars to concatinate onto the end of the 1st string.                                   *|
|*    3)  "strncmp()" takes 2 strings.  It compares the strings and returns an integer value.             *|
|*        0 = the strings are the same. >0 = the 1st string is greater than the 2nd.                      *|
|*        <0 = the 1st string is less than the 2nd string (ascii value).  The int determines from the     *|
|*        first character in the 2nd string, how many chars to compare with the 1st string.               *|
|*    4)  "strncpy()" takes 2 strings.  It copies the 2nd string onto the 1st string, overwriting         *|
|*        the 1st.  The int determines from the first character in the 2nd string, how many chars to      *|
|*        copy from the 2nd string to the 1st string.                                                     *|
|*                                                                                                        *|
|*    MOTORS & SENSORS:                                                                                   *|
